FEATURES
--------

You can:

 - focus a window (click)
 - move a window (Alt + left drag)
 - resize a window (Alt + right drag)
 - close a window by killing its owner (Alt + middle click, not recommended)

Assignment of the mouse buttons can be changed via config.h.

DISCLAIMER

It lacks many features which real world window managers have, for example:

 - maximization and minimization
 - multi monitor (Xinerama, RandR) support
 - desktop integration (ICCCM, EWMH) support
